----------------------

1) Correlation Coeff  Age and Absenteeism = 
VAR AvgAge = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Absenteeism at work'[Age]))
VAR AvgAbsenteeism = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Absenteeism at work'[Absenteeism time in hours]))

VAR Numerator = sumx('Absenteeism at work',('Absenteeism at work'[Age] - AvgAge) * ('Absenteeism at work'[Absenteeism time in hours] - AvgAbsenteeism))
VAR Denominator = SQRT(sumx('Absenteeism at work',('Absenteeism at work'[Age] - AvgAge) ^ 2) * sumx('Absenteeism at work',('Absenteeism at work'[Absenteeism time in hours] - AvgAbsenteeism) ^ 2))

RETURN
    DIVIDE(Numerator,Denominator,0)


2) Correlation Coeff Distance and Absenteeism = 
VAR AvgDist = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Absenteeism at work'[Distance from Residence to Work]))
VAR AvgAbsenteeism = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Absenteeism at work'[Absenteeism time in hours]))

VAR Numerator = sumx('Absenteeism at work',('Absenteeism at work'[Distance from Residence to Work] - AvgDist) * ('Absenteeism at work'[Absenteeism time in hours] - AvgAbsenteeism))
VAR Denominator = SQRT(sumx('Absenteeism at work',('Absenteeism at work'[Distance from Residence to Work] - AvgDist) ^ 2) * sumx('Absenteeism at work',('Absenteeism at work'[Absenteeism time in hours] - AvgAbsenteeism) ^ 2))

RETURN
    DIVIDE(Numerator,Denominator,0)
