# 🛒 Project 10: E-Commerce Sales Pipeline in Databricks (Medallion Architecture)

## 📅 Date: 24 September 2025
Folder Link [Databricks_DE_proj1_Ecommerce](./Databricks_DE_proj1_Ecommerce/)

## ℹ️  About the Project

This project demonstrates how to build an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** using **Databricks, PySpark, and Delta tables**, following the **Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.  
The pipeline transforms raw e-commerce sales CSVs into business-ready fact and dimension tables, enabling KPI reporting and dashboards.

## 📁 Data Source: 
- A **dummy e-commerce dataset** was created to simulate real-world sales data.  
- Includes 4 CSV files ingested into the Bronze layer:
  - `customers` → basic customer profiles (id, name, region, signup date)  
  - `orders` → order headers (order id, customer id, order date, status)  
  - `order_items` → order line items (order_item id, order id, product id, quantity, unit price)  
  - `products` → product catalog (product id, name, category, list price)  
- Data was intentionally seeded with minor imperfections (blank fields, inconsistent casing, mixed date formats, `$` signs in prices) to demonstrate cleaning and transformation in the Silver layer.
