# Project 3: Power BI Absenteeism at Work Dashboard
Folder Link [PowerBI Proj-1]
Free Kaggle dataset used for analysis, original source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kewagbln/absenteeism-at-work-uci-ml-repositiory.
The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.

Number of Instances: 740
Number of Attributes: 21
Missing Values: 0

The analysis done includes creating a new table relationship in Power BI by creating a new master of Reason for absence ID and Reason for absence description. It also includes analysis of which reason is the leading factor contributing to absenteeism at work, along with correlation analysis of factors such as 'Age' and 'Distance from Residence to Work', with total absenteeism in hours for employees.
